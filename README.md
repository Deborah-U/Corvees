## Problem

**Dividing Chores**: Whether it be among siblings or roommates, dividing chores are a hassle as everyone wants an “equal” amount of chores or the “easy chores.

**Responsibility**: When you delegate roles, people tend to forget and are not held accountable for their assigned chores. They also tend to claim they were never told.

**Inventory**: It’s hard to keep track of how many toilet paper or trash bags you have and who should restock.

## Our Solution 

Chore-Lite:
* Delegate chores by head of household or by online generator.
* Holds the roommate/sibling accountable by having a notification sent to the roommate to remind them of their daily chores.
* Monitors household inventory
* Can delegate roommates/siblings to restock items that are running low or gone.
